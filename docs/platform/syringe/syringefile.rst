.. _syringefile:

The ``syringe.yaml`` File
================================

Syringe uses a totally file-driven approach to lesson definitions. This allows us to store all lessons as "code"
within a Git repository, rather than maintain a database of lesson state all the time. When syringe starts,
it looks for lesson definitions within a directory, loads them into memory, and serves them directly via its API.

.. note::
    The way that ``syringe.yaml`` files are put together is still a work-in-progress. Be prepared for changes to
    the below information, as we improve Syringe and make it (hopefully) easier to put these lesson files together.

These lesson definitions are written in YAML. A very simple example is shown below. This file describes a very
simple lesson in two parts, with a single linux container for interactivity:

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  lessonName: Introduction to YAML
  lessonID: 14
  category: introductory
  topologyType: none

  utilities:
  - name: linux1
    image: antidotelabs/utility
    sshuser: antidote
    sshpassword: antidotepassword

      description: Dictionaries (key/value pairs)

A more complicated example adds network devices to the mix. This not only adds images to the file, but
we also need to add a list of connections for Syringe to place between our network devices, as well as
configurations to apply to each device at each lesson stage:

.. code:: yaml
