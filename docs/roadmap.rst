Roadmap
================================

This is a new fast-moving project in alpha and under much development still.

The Antidote roadmap will move faster than its reference runtime
:ref:`NRE Labs <nrelabs>`. And the Antidote infrastructure is eventually
expected to move slower than the contributions and releases of new Lessons.

If you find an issue to report, or want to work on Antidote infrastructure or
curriculum, please use the project
`issues <https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote/issues>`_ list on GitHub.
